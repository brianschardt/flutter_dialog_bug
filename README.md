# This is to demonstrate a very noticable bug in flutter with their drawers

if you run the app, 
click open drawer it opens(works as expected)
Now click screen1, then click the back arrow, then click open drawer

Now you get this error
```
The method 'openDrawer' was called on null.
Receiver: null
Tried calling: openDrawer()
```

How can we fix?
